## Project Reflection
[Hui Feng](https://github.com/TLI-Tristan)
The project seems to be basic but enough to graps the concept of fullstack development. It doesn't seem a lot but something I am proud of is doing access control and account anthentication. There was a lot to understand in order to implement it, but nonetheless it's a feature that i wish to improve on and learn more about it. Integrating multiple APIs seems to be practical and useful to provide value to our users.
